## Project Description
* The [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) dataset is provided by Kaggle.
*	The following data mining models are used to predict which customers are likely to be satisfied or dissatisfied and determine which features are associated with satisfaction:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Penalized Logistic Regression
    * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    * PLSDA
    * MDA
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * Boosted Tree 
    * k-Nearest Neighbors
    * Neural Network
